# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Use this section to tell people about which versions of your project are
currently being supported with security updates.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

For the time being, we will be using the issues tab to report vulnerabilities since the option for new security advisories is not showing up under the security tab. I will update you once I figure out why.
At a bare minimum, vulnerability reports will update weekly, if not sooner. Anyone can claim a vulnerability from the issues tab; if we identify a risk beyond the scope of our project to deal with for some reason, we will accept the risk and move on.
